Zombie Project - a simple console game in which you have to survive in an unfair world full of zombies. 
You come to your senses in an empty New York, which is full of zombies. 
All you have in your pockets is a knife, Coca-Kolya, and a loaf of bread. 
For now, all you need is to survive, and how to achieve this is up to you. 
So get up and don't waste a single moment on empty thoughts, otherwise you simply won't survive

Хочу зробити якийсь елемент рандому де:
    1. Nothing
    2. Enemy
    3. New items
    
2. Inventory
In the start player has a inventory with 5 empty slots. I don't know exactly how I have to display it on the screen, something like:
1. Knife
2. Coca-Kolya 
3. Loaf of Bread
4. empty
5. empty

That class must have a function called showInventory, which display all items in the inventory on the console
In the future it will have a function, that can change the size of the inventory(upgrade it)

3. Quit
