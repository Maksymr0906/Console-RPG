As I cautiously explore the desolate streets, I find nothing of interest or significance.
Found nobody and nothing. How can I survive here?
I searched in the mall. Unfortunately, apart from wreckage and corpses, I did not find anything.
I heard the sounds of shots nearby. I should be more careful.
I was thinking of finding something useful in the subway. The nests of mutants on the way down made me change my mind.
I found a large safe in one of the offices. I was able to open it pretty quickly. Unfortunately, there were only a few letters.
Found an old car on the road. I searched the interior and trunk. Found nothing.
I saw a crashed helicopter on the edge of the roof. Went up to the roof and searched the helicopter. Again nothing found.
Time passed quietly.
I saw bandits beating an unarmed boy. It's a pity that I can't help him.
The atmosphere of abandoned houses and corpses on the roads scares me. I need to move on.
It used to be the most popular museum in the whole country. Now it is just a pile of ashes and ruins.
Nearby I hear the sounds of zombies. I need to bypass this place.
The air is eerily quiet. I cautiously continue my journey.
A gust of wind rustles through the abandoned streets. I remain vigilant.
A crow caws in the distance, breaking the silence. I keep moving.
The abandoned cars stand motionless on the street. I stay watchful.
Carefully exploring the street, I find nothing new.
I feel as if someone is following me. I wonder if it is really so?
